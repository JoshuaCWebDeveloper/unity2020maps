# Unity 2020 Maps
Lightweight mapping utility to display areas that the Unity2020 Analytics team believes are most likely to be receptive to our message. Volunteers may use this to zoom in to their location to see what hotspot neighborhoods exist nearby.

Issues:

- This map does not render properly on mobile. This is a problem because volunteers are most likely to use this map on their mobile device while exploring hotspot areas.

- Currently this map is only hosted in Github pages. It needs a permanent home.
